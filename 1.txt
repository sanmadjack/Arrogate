Erin, gasping for breath, leaned against the wall of the sewer. She panted for a few seconds, and then heard a crackling noise echoing through the tunnels. Her vision darted around, trying to find the source of the noise. Several meters back in the direction she had run from she could see the pitch-black corridors starting to light up, revealing thin walkways parallel to a recessed flow of sludge and an arching concrete ceiling. Erin felt her way along the wall, away from the light, until about a meter down she found an intersection. She continued down the perpendicular path, but she could hear the footsteps growing louder. Hoping to find some way to hide from her pursuer, Erin hastened her pace. To her fortune another intersection gave her the opportunity to put some stone between her and the stalker. Erin listened carefully to the steps in the distance as they stopped. A few seconds later they continued, but mercifully with a descending volume. Erin took a deep breath and whispered a small thanks to whomever or whatever had granted her this small miracle. She reached over and touched the burn on her left arm, hoping to finally get a bit of pain out of it. Erin winced a bit, but the wound still didn't hurt anywhere near as much as it should, which led her mind to thoughts of nerve damage.
Thinking better of sitting around too long Erin continued along the wall, her right hand only lightly keeping contact with it for guidance. Her eyes had attempted to adjust to the darkness, but there was only so much that could be done without any light. She reached another intersection and peeked down the new path. In the distance she saw a tiny glimmer of light far down the tunnel. Erin moved closer to the wall so that her hand could lead her as she walked faster. After she had halved the distance between her and the light, she noticed that the light was actually bobbing up and down. Her eyes went wide and she stumbled backwards, her left foot landing on an insecure stone. Her leg slipped down into the sludge, and her body landed on the pavement. At the splash and thud the light ahead started bobbing faster. Erin could hear the familiar footsteps coming toward her and struggled to pull herself back to her feet. She brought her left leg back up out of the sludge and tried to run, but instantly found her left ankle had twisted too far when she slipped. Behind her the footsteps were now running, a sound which caused Erin no small amount of panic. She limped as fast as she could, but the hand grabbing the back of her neck proved that it was futile. The hand didn't slow her down, instead opting to continue the pace while pushing the side of her face against the wall. As Erin's cheek and ear started grinding off she desperately grabbed with her right arm, trying in vain to wrest herself free from her overachieving exfoliator's grasp. Erin was flung across the sludge into the opposing wall, gravity slamming her back onto the walkway front-down. The figure then leaped across the meter-wide sludge river, landing just behind Erin. It reached down and around to grasp her throat from the front and pulled her head up, arcing her back. The figure moved its mouth by the bloody nub that was her ear and whispered.
“It's mine.” 
Erin's throat was released, but before she had a chance to fall to the ground a crackling, glowing stick was jabbed into her back. Erin screamed briefly before the figure hooked its foot under her body and flipped her into the sludge.
“Don't you ever forget it.”
      
Erin awoke in her apartment with a start, a cold sweat contrasting the ambient heat. A red glow pulled her eyes to a digital display, the hellfire within torturing her with its stenciled output. Frustrated, she rose out of the bed just as the clock changed to conclude with triple zeros. She planted one foot firmly on the floor, and then shifted her weight to pull the other behind. As her leg slid across the bed, the sheet seemingly wrapped itself around her ankle, thwarting her departure and sending her to the floor. Pulling herself back up she called out, strands of her long black hair blowing away from her with the melodic sound of her voice.
"Turn on the fucking lights!"  
The lights briefly flickered, but ultimately opted to ignore her. Resigned to her fate in an under-lit existence, Erin stumbled towards her bathroom on the opposite side of her one room apartment. Three-quarters there she again found herself face down on the floor, this time sent there by a broom that was paradoxically cluttering up the floor. She briefly considered putting forth the effort to regain her status as a biped, but decided she'd use less energy crawling the remaining fourth.
Reaching the linoleum floor, Erin tossed her torso up onto the edge of the tub. Playing with the tub's knobs she found an acceptable balance of freezing and burning, and then flipped the little switch that activated the shower head. Falling back onto the floor she reached down and pulled off her pajama top, and then tossed it in the general direction of the sink. She again hauled herself up and then over the edge of tub, her limp frame flopping down under the stream of water. She lay there for several minutes absorbing the energy of the warm water into her tired body and pants. Finally feeling recharged enough she stood and grabbed the shampoo from the small shower shelf. Lathering her hair, she tried coaxing her mind into revealing what she had to do today. Unfortunately, it was still too early for her and her mind to be able to coordinate the physical activity of washing herself, much less to discuss agendas.
The stinging of her eyes reminded her of her mother washing her hair as a child. Erin's mother had a bad habit of bathing her daughter while on the phone, and although the players had changed, the screaming stayed the same. She plunged her face under the falling water, rinsing the burning feeling from her eyes. After flushing the rest of the vile chemicals from her hair, she turned off the water. Her arm swung out of the shower, finally hitting what passed for a towel on the rack adjacent to the tub. She pulled the soft cloth to herself, and then used it to dry her upper half. Draping the towel over her torso like a third of a robe, she stepped out of the bathtub to the sink.
When Erin was young there had been a public television show her parents would sit her in front of that preached the virtues of preserving the environment. Conservation was the biggest method they taught, including not wasting precious water. Thanks to such masterfully crafted propaganda she learned early in her life that protecting the world was in everyone's best interest. Unfortunately they were less effective when it came to teaching her to care. She blasted the sink with all the water that the spout would give her and set about brushing her teeth. As she scrubbed away at her molars she rested her other hand on the edge of the sink.
A few moments later Erin's hand felt wet, prompting her to look at it. The water running over the edge of the sink didn't really bother her, but she figured it would probably bother the owners of the building, who in turn would bother her. She reached into the sink and pulled out her soaked pajama top, then tossed it back at the tub. Erin swished her toothbrush around in the sink, then leaned down and sucked up a mouthful of water. A quick swish later she returned the liquid to the retreating pool.
Satisfied with how clean she was, Erin exited the bathroom. Immediately outside the bathroom door she swung around to face her dresser. Atop her dresser was a photo of her and her boyfriend Kalo on a camping trip. She smiled, thinking back to when the picture was taken. She detested camping, but Kalo was an indomitable outdoorsman. They had been going out for almost three years, and she treasured every moment they were together. They were going to meet again later this very morning at 9:30. She smiled to herself as she checked the time on her mobile on the top of her desk. She shoved the mobile into her pants pocket, then threw on a green patterned top that was draped over the foot of her bed. A pair of sandals by the door were abruptly violated by her feet on their way out the door into the hallway.
After running past several dozen doors Erin arrived at an elevator, the button adjacent to which she smacked with much fervor and frequency. Soon, though not nearly soon enough for her liking, the elevator doors slid open. In one smooth motion she rushed into the elevator, turned around and pushed the "1" button, prompting the doors to shut and the elevator to descend. Erin began pacing, wondering what she was going to tell Kalo.
Once again the doors parted before her, granting Erin access to the small rectangular lobby. She ran across the faux-marble floor, completely missing the wet floor sign in the middle of the room. Three-quarters toward the other end of the room she felt the friction leave her soles, and with it the support her legs provided her with. She was running fast enough for her momentum to skid her along the wet floor the rest of the way to the door. The door didn't open thanks to its lock, so all the force left in her frame went into the meeting of her body and the wood. Erin pulled herself up with the door handle, and then leaned forward on it. Now unlocked, the door opened easily. 
Erin was descending the short staircase connecting the door to the sidewalk when a hand grabbed her left arm. As her momentum swung her around, Erin raised her right arm and balled her hand into a fist, ready to strike out at whoever decided that grabbing her was more important than her getting to her meeting. Her fist swung towards the man that grabbed her, but was deflected by his own arm, then twisted around so that it was beneath his arm. He grasped her right arm with his hand just above her elbow, locking her in place. Erin struggled for a moment before realizing that it was Kalo. 
“You know how I feel about boyfriend abuse, Erin.”
Erin smiled wide. “Well maybe if you wouldn't scare me I wouldn't have to pull the whole negative reinforcement thing.”
Erin slipped her arms out of Kalo's now loosened grip and slid forward, wrapping her arms around him.  
“I'm so sorry, my alarm didn't go off.” Erin snuggled the side of her face against his chest.
“Did you set the alarm?”
“Well...no. I forgot.”
“It's alright.” Kalo pushed her away so that they could look at each other's face again. “All for the best, really.”
Erin noticed that Kalo didn't look nearly as happy as she was, a realization that drained the feeling from her own mood. Kalo's expression shifted a bit sadder. “I broke your smile.”
Erin half-smiled, finding a full smile difficult to attain. Kalo sat down on the steps in front of her apartment, pulling her arm so that she sat next to him. Erin opened her mouth then closed it again, looking contemplative. A second later she verbally decided "I'm confused."
Kalo laughed. "I envy you, Erin. You're content in a way I've never been."
Erin smirked and put her arm around Kalo. "That's 'cause I've got you."
Kalo slid away from her across the step. "Erin...please. This is crushing my spirit enough as it is. Look, I...a few months back, I signed up to go to Nineveh. I'm leaving the planet."
Erin looked down at her feet with a silence that could have made a rock jealous. After a few moments she spoke up, still looking down at her feet. 
“Am I going too? Did we sign up and I forgot about it?”
Kalo shook his head. “No. Just me.”
"Does that mean you're breaking up with me?"
"Yes, it does. I thought about asking you to sign up too, but..." 
Erin snapped her head towards Kalo, showing her eyes beginning to moisten.
"But you didn't want me to."
Kalo looked shocked and shook his head.
“No, that's not it. It's just...I know you Erin. If I had suggested it you would never have gone for it. You hate change. Look at you; you didn't even change out of your pajamas before you showered.” Kalo pointed at her pants, which had been leaking water onto the pavement where she was sitting, before continuing. “But I'm not content here, I feel...stagnant.”
“Why does that mean you have to leave the planet? What's out there that's worth leaving me behind?”
Kalo pointed upward with his thumb. "Out there is the opportunity for me to be the man I've always wanted to be."
"And you can't be that with me?"
"Dammit, Erin. This isn't about me or you, it's something bigger. This is why I decided to put off telling you until today."  
"Today?"
Kalo nodded. "The ship I'm on is leaving tonight."
Erin looked horrified. "What the hell?"
"I know, I know, and I'm sorry. I tried to tell you when I signed up, but every time I thought I'd worked up the nerve you'd do something unbearably sweet and I'd feel like an asshat. It's that damn sweet smile, kept making me feel three centimeters tall."
Kalo waited for Erin to respond, but was instead surprised by her fist hitting his arm. He turned and saw Erin, mouth open with her fist still raised. She began to say "You..." then punched him again.
"You fucker!"
Kalo got up and backed away, extending a hand toward Erin.
"I deserve that. This is a pretty shitty thing I'm doing, but you gotta believe me when..."
Erin stood up from the stairs, pointing an accusative finger at Kalo.
"I don't gotta believe shit! You're ditching me so you can go play pioneer!"
Kalo seemed angered by the belittlement and raised his finger back at Erin.
"This is what I was talking about. You're fucking attitude toward my life goals..."
"Fuck your life goals!" Erin screamed back at him, her cheeks staining with tears. The scream started attracting the attention of several pedestrians as Erin rushed forward and tried to take another swing at Kalo. Kalo side stepped the punch and she stumbled off the sidewalk onto the street. She turned around and rushed him again, but this time Kalo grabbed the incoming punch and spun Erin around, locking her arm behind her. Erin jabbed with her other arm's elbow, but it failed to faze him. Kalo looked around at the small group of a half-dozen onlookers that was gathering around, then spoke equally to them and Erin.
"We're done. I'm leaving."
Kalo released Erin and quickly walked through the people towards his car. Erin watched him until he reached the door to his car, then yelled and rushed at him again.
"I'm gonna fucking kill you, you sack of shit!"
Fortunately for Kalo a large man in a police uniform who had joined the crowd hooked his arm around Erin's waist as she ran by, lifting her up off the ground. Erin flailed against the man, who remained silent as Kalo got in his car and drove away. Erin continued to scream at Kalo until he disappeared into the traffic. After the man finally replaced her onto the ground, Erin looked up at him. She half-heartedly punched the man's stomach, and addressed him equally without motivation.
"Thank you. Now fuck off."

The man nodded his head and walked away, shooing away the few straggling onlookers as he went. Erin turned and walked in the other direction. A few blocks along, she reached into her pocket and pulled out her mobile, then activated the contact entry for Alyx. After a few rings the speaker clicked and a female voice spoke.
“Hey Erin. I thought you'd be calling soon.”
“You did?”
“Yeah Kalo was visiting us last night, and he and Jim talked for a long time. Jim told me about what Kalo was planning to do afterwards. Are you alright?”
“I feel like shit. I made a spectacle of myself on the street with the asshole.”
“Yeah, I'm sorry hon. It's sort of Jim's fault. Him and Kalo were talking awhile back and Kalo started going on about how he felt like his life wasn't going anywhere, and Jim told him he should do something about it. I didn't quite understand the thought processes, men thinking the way they do and all, but somehow Kalo reached the conclusion that he should go out and join a colony.”
“I figured out that part. I just can't figure out why he thought I was holding him back.”
“Did he say that?”
“Well, he said that he wasn't content with the way his life is. Besides that, he's leaving the planet. That sorta implies that he wants all of us out of his life.”
“Now that's not necessarily true. Kalo's always talked about going out on adventures and exploring and stuff. Some people have life goals that transcend everything else in their life. Kalo is just a driven person.”
“Now there's something I don't get. His life is so perfect, how could he want to throw that away?”
“Perfect? Now how do you figure that?”
“He's got so many friends, he has a job he enjoys, no family to nag him, and of course a girlfriend that adores him. It's like my dream life, but with two reversed genders.”
“I think he'd have a different opinion on some of those things. But still, even with that, Kalo has goals that are what he thinks are his purpose in life. To a lot of people an honest-to-goodness purpose can be more important than anything.”
“Being with Kalo was the closest I got to feeling something was what I should be doing. But now that's gone.'
“Well, maybe you should start searching for another purpose. Something all your own.”
Erin stopped by a bus stop and looked around. “I've never actually looked for one. I always figured if I did have a purpose it would just come to me, maybe even be something I had all along. I figured that was how it worked.”
“Well, maybe it will for you, but you really need to find something. We don't like to see you...staying in place like you are. Stagnation isn't good for anyone.”
“Stagnant. That's what Kalo said he had become. His solution was to leave the planet.”
“Well I don't think it's necessary to go to that length. Plenty of people lead fulfilled lives right here at home.”
“But maybe it is. Kalo had lofty ideals and he was only relatively still compared to where he wanted to be. My ideals have never been anywhere near lofty, and I'm practically a statue. Me and him, we're practically in the same rut. Maybe I need to do something equally as drastic to get out of mine.”
“Now, don't go doing anything crazy. You shouldn't...”
“Sorry Alyx. I got to go.” Erin cut her off, putting her hand on an advertisement on the bus stop. Erin turned off her mobile, and then took her hand off the large poster of the planet Nineveh.
