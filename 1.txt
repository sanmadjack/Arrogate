Chapter 1: 

She awoke with a start, tingling burning flowing down her spine. Feeling a pair of hands crushing her arms, she was dragged along a course surface. Amidst the sensory haze that was her world the grinding of her flesh through the holes in her coverings gave her something to clearly feel. She struggled to focus on the owner of the clutches that held her, then blurred as her spine arced, buzzing white hot. Darkness gave her a brief respite until her skull impacting a hard surface bought her to a world of blinding light. Behind the deafening bells a diminutive voice announced itself, concluding with an upturned tone. Focus now refused to assert itself in either sight or sound, only ghostly apparitions of either taking form. The voice again. The weak mumble of her own voice made itself known, but with no more shape than the other. Pain visited her, the convulsions grinding her arms and legs against flexible yet stiff materials circling her limbs. The voice returned, its melody the same. Her own voice tried to reappear but was substituted by a coarse breaking. The voice sang a different melody, the tone descending. Another bass joined the choir, almost loud enough to break the aural fog. Suddenly everything was clear: the room, the chair, the man in the apron, why she stole her best friend's tricycle when she was six. Finally able to construct a thought, her first was that it was odd how the floor was turning red.

She awoke with a start, tingling sweat flowing down her spine. The red glow pulled her eyes to the digital display, the hellfire within torturing her with its stenciled output. Frustrated, she rose out of the bed just as the clock clicked over to conclude with double zeros. A shrill buzzing filled the air as the room brightened. The sudden light blinded her, causing her to trip over her sheets, face-planting onto the carpeted floor. Puling herself back up she called out, strands of the long black hair that had fallen in front of her face blew away from her with the melodic sound of her voice.
    "Turn off the fucking lights!"
    But like a stoic statue of Buddha, the lights didn't give a damn. Resigned to her fate in a well-lit existence, she stumbled towards her bathroom on the opposite side of her one room. Three-quarters there, she again found herself face down on the floor, sent there by <plot item here> -Sanmadjack 1/20/09 5:55 PM. She briefly considered putting forth the effort to regain her status as a biped, but decided she'd use less energy crawling the remaining fourth.
    Reaching the linoleum floor, she tossed her torso up onto the edge of the tub. Playing with the tub's knobs, she found an acceptable balance of freezing and burning, then flipped the little switch that activated the shower head. Falling back onto the floor, she reached down and pulled off her pajama top, then tossed it in the general direction of the sink. She again hauled herself up and then over the edge of tub, flopping her limp frame down under the stream of water. She lay there for several minutes, absorbing the energy of the warm water into her tired body and pants. Finally feeling recharged enough, she stood up and grabbed the shampoo from the small shower shelf. Lathering her hair, she coaxed her mind to reveal what she had to do today. Unfortunately it was still too early for her and her mind to be able to coordinate the physical activity of washing herself, much less discussing agendas.
    The stinging of her eyes reminded her of her mother washing her hair as a child. Her mother had a bad habit of bathing her daughter while on the phone. Though the players had changed, the screaming stayed the same. She plunged her face under the water, rinsing the burning feeling from her eyes. After flushing the rest of the vile chemical from her hair, she turned off the water. Her arm swung out of the shower, finally hitting what passed for a towel on the rack adjacent to the tub. She pulled the soft cloth to herself, then used it to dry her upper half. Draping the towel over her torso like a third of a robe, she stepped out of the bathtub to the sink.
	When she was young there was a show her parents would sit her in front of that preached the virtues of preserving the environment. Conservation was the biggest method they taught, including not wasting running water. Thanks to such masterfully crafted propaganda, she learned early in her life that protecting the world was in everyone's best interest. Unfortunately they were less effective when it came to teaching her to care. She blasted the sink with all the water that the spout would give her and set about brushing her teeth. As she scrubbed away at her molars, she rested her other hand on the edge of the sink.
	A few moments later her hand felt cold, prompting her to look at it. The water running over the edge of the sink didn't really bother her, but she figured it would probably bother the owners of the building, who in turn would bother her. She reached into the sink and pulled out her soaked pajama top, then tossed it at the toilet. She swished her toothbrush around in the sink, cleaning it off, then leaned down and sucked up a mouthful of water. A quick swish later she returned the liquid the the retreating pool.
	Satisfied with how clean she was, she exited the bathroom. Immediately outside the bathroom door, she swung around to face her dresser. <how se figured things out here>. -Sanmadjack 1/20/09 5:55 PM She quickly stuffed her mobile into her pants pocket and threw on a green patterned top that was draped over the foot of her bed. A pair of bunny slippers by the door were abruptly violated by her feet, after which she zipped out the door.


    Kalo rapped his fingers against the table of the booth we was seated in. He was used to his girlfriend being late, so this time he had told her to meet him half an hour before he even planned on arriving.
